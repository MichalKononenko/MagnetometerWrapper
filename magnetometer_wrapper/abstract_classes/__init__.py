Contains partial implementations of the interfaces. Add modules here if
there are common methods across multiple classes, or if the interfaces need
to be simplified. The classes defined in this package will tend to have
smaller sets of abstract methods that need to be implemented, at the cost of
conflicts when doing multiple inheritance.
